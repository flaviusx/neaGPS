neaGPS
======
This is the branch of XWiki-CLAMS and currikiorg dedicated to gps.nea.org, a sharing platform for the Great Public Schools project of the National Education Association in Washington, DC, USA.

This fork and branch intends to live in parallel to currikiorg and other xclams branches.

The neaGPS codebase is hosted here, except for configuration. It employs [XWiki jira](http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CURRIKI) as issue tracker, an internal continuous development server, a development server, a beta server, and a production server.
