*WASHINGTON, D.C.  November 13, 2006* – Curriki - the Global Education &amp; Learning Community today announced that Anne Schreiber, an accomplished educator, author and publisher, has been named the company’s Chief Academic Officer.  

In her role as Chief Academic Officer, Schreiber will drive the educational mission of Curriki, strengthen existing academic programs, develop innovative strategies for expanding educational activities and ensure the efficacy of Curriki’s objectives in creating a global interactive online community offering free and Open Source Curriculum.

"Anne is a natural choice to serve as Curriki’s Chief Academic Officer because she has exhibited a strong commitment to quality curricula and an intense passion for education throughout her career," said Dr. Barbara Kurshan, Curriki's Executive Director. ”World-class curricula is the backbone of Curriki’s offering and Anne’s direction and guidance will ensure that teachers and students around the world will be receiving access to the best curricula when they visit curriki.org.”

“Serving as Curriki’s Chief Academic Officer is more than a job,” stated Anne Schrieber, Curriki’s new Chief Academic Officer. “It is a chance to end the Education Divide and work with a community of educational professionals to bring quality curricula within reach to anyone who wants to teach and anyone who wants to learn."

Schreiber brings with her more than 20 years of experience in developing curriculum as an educator, author, and publisher.  Most recently, Schreiber was Vice president of the Product Group at The Grow Network/McGraw-Hill, where she created and implemented assessment-based instructional programs for students, parents and educators.  Before joining The Grow Network/McGraw-Hill, Schreiber served in many roles at Scholastic Inc., including Publisher of Secondary Curriculum, Executive Editor/Director of Technology and Supervising Editor. She spearheaded, designed and implemented the award-winning K-2 print and technology literacy system WiggleWorks as well as many other literacy programs.  Also at Scholastic Inc., Schreiber was the Associate Content Director of an award-winning science TV series.

Earlier in her career, Schreiber held a range of positions from product development to teaching at companies and institutions including bigchalk, Time Warner and Children’s Television Workshop, and at elementary schools in rural New York State.  In addition, Schreiber served as a consultant for various professional development programs including PBS Teacher Line, the New Teacher Center and Disney.   

Schrieber did her undergraduate and graduate work in Curriculum and Instruction and Science Education at Cornell University. She is the author of more than a dozen books for young children.
